# KLJ Stekene - The Website

The purpose of this website and project is to create a centralized platform where members, leaders, parents, sponsors, supporters, and others can find all relevant information. This platform is designed to eventually replace or supplement all existing channels of communication (currently it is intended to supplement until everything is fully functional).

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Fast Node Manager (FNM)](https://fnm.vercel.app) (Not yet required, but will be in the future)

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or an equivalent package manager (Check the `package.json` for the required versions)
